TagRec
======

## Towards A Standardized Tag Recommender Benchmarking Framework
* TagRec is developed by the Social Computing research area of [Know-Center](https://www.know-center.tugraz.at/en/) and [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/fakultaeten/csbme/home/)
* TagRec won the best poster award @ Hypertext 2014 (HT'14) conference: [http://ht.acm.org/ht2014/index.php?awards.poster](http://ht.acm.org/ht2014/index.php?awards.poster)
* TagRec is also a main part of the recommender systems in the Layers project [http://results.learning-layers.eu/infrastructure/sss/services/tag-rec/](http://results.learning-layers.eu/infrastructure/sss/services/tag-rec/)
* TagRec is part of several lists of recommender systems frameworks or courses such as [http://fmoraes.nl/se-recsys-paperswithcode/](http://fmoraes.nl/se-recsys-paperswithcode/), [https://github.com/grahamjenson/list_of_recommender_systems](https://github.com/grahamjenson/list_of_recommender_systems), and [https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa17/cse291-b/](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa17/cse291-b/)

## Description
The aim of [TagRec](http://www.dominikkowald.info/documents/2017umap_tagrec.pdf) (please [cite](https://github.com/learning-layers/TagRec/#citation)) is to provide the community with a simple to use, generic tag-recommender framework written in Java to evaluate novel tag-recommender algorithms with a set of well-known std. IR metrics such as nDCG, MAP, MRR, Precision (P@k), Recall (R@k), F1-score (F1@k), Diversity (D), Serendipity (S), User Coverage (UC) and folksonomy datasets such as BibSonomy, CiteULike, LastFM, Flickr, MovieLens or Delicious and to benchmark the developed approaches against state-of-the-art tag-recommender algorithms such as MP, MP_r, MP_u, MP_u,r, CF, APR, FR, GIRP, GIRPTM, etc.

Furthermore, it contains algorithms to process datasets (e.g., p-core pruning, leave-one-out or 80/20 splitting, LDA topic creation and create input files for other recommender frameworks).

The software already contains four novel tag-recommender approaches based on cognitive science theory. The first one ([3Layers](http://www.christophtrattner.info/pubs/cikm2013.pdf)) (Seitlinger et al, 2013) uses topic information and is based on the ALCOVE/MINERVA2 theories (Krutschke, 1992; Hintzman, 1984). The second one ([BLL+C](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2580000/2576934/p463-kowald.pdf)) (Kowald et al., 2014b) uses time information is based on the ACT-R theory (Anderson et al., 2004). The third one ([3LT](http://www.christophtrattner.info/pubs/msm8_kowald.pdf)) (Kowald et al., 2015b) is a combination of the former two approaches and integrates the time component on the level of tags and topics. Finally, the fourth one ([BLLac+MPr](http://www.christophtrattner.info/pubs/msm7_kowald.pdf)) extends the BLL+C algorithm with semantic correlations (Kowald et al., 2015a).

Apart from this, TagRec also contains algorithms for the personalized recommendation of resources / items in social tagging systems. In this respect TagRec includes a novel algorithm called [CIRTT](http://www.christophtrattner.info/pubs/sp2014.pdf) (Lacic et al., 2014) that integrates tag and time information using the BLL-equation coming from the ACT-R theory (Anderson et al, 2004). Furthermore, it contains another novel item-recommender called [SUSTAIN+CFu](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.07716v1.pdf) (Seitlinger et al., 2015) that improves user-based CF via integrating the addentional focus of users via the SUSTAIN model (Love et al., 2004).

TagRec was also utilized for the [recommendation of hashtags in Twitter](http://www.dominikkowald.info/documents/2017www_twitter.pdf) (Kowald et al., 2017). Thus, it contains an initial set of algorithms for this task as well. For this, TagRec also contains a connection to the Apache Solr search engine framework. Finally, we also utilized TagRec for [predicting and recommendation music preferences](http://www.dominikkowald.info/documents/2020iui_humanize.pdf). Here, all tag recommendation algorithms can also be used for predicting music artists and genres.
